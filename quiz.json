        "explanation": "When a person with COVID-19 coughs, breathes out or sneezes, droplets come out from their nose and mouth which can contain the virus. These can be breathed in by people who are nearby or land on surfaces which other people can then touch. Regularly washing your hands and keeping your distance from others is the best way to prevent COVID-19."

There’s also no evidence that these people are more likely to become seriously ill if they do get the COVID-19. The people who need to be more careful are those with a low CD4 count (<200 copies/cell), a high viral load, or those who have had a recent opportunistic infection. If this applies to you speak to your health care worker for more advice."

        "explanation": "<p>The World Health Organisation now recommends using face masks when you are not able to stay at least 1 meter away from others. This includes when you’re on public transport, inside shops, or any other time when you’re in a confined or crowded space.</p><p>This is because we now have evidence that some people who get COVID-19 don’t get any symptoms but can still pass the virus on. Wearing fabric masks prevent these asymptomatic and seemingly healthy people from passing on the virus in public spaces. If you do have symptoms for COVID-19, you still need to stay home and self-isolate - wearing a mask is not enough.</p>"
